In 2009, we're celebrating our next step - becoming Indiana's largest 100% employee-owned food distributor. We are proud to say that when you call McFarling Foods, you're always speaking to an owner. Although our ownership structure has changed, our customers know they can expect the same commitment to service and quality brands that have helped the company become what it is today. McFarling Foods sells CODE, COMPANIONS, CORTONA, and WORLD HORIZON label products, in addition to hundreds of familiar national-labeled lines.
